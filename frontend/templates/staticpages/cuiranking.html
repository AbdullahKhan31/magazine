            <p style="color:black;">

            Establishment of an IT Institution in Abbottabad was a visionary challenge of Dr. Atta-ur-Rehman, Minister of Science and Technology of the time. COMSATS came forward to accept this challenge as an opportunity, which was converted in to reality by the Founding Director of the campus, Dr. Haroon Rashid. Pakistan Army did the greatest service to the cause of education by offering 308 kanals of land at Tobe camp for establishing an IT Institute, which was graciously transferred by Pakistan Military and gratefully accepted by COMSATS University Islamabad.
