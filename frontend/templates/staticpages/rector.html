            </a></span>COMSATS University Islamabad is a name well recognized among the Higher Education Institutions of the country and I am proud to share with you that it has become the prime choice for higher studies. During the past fourteen years, COMSATS University Islamabad has developed into one of the largest multidisciplinary universities and the leader of change in the education scenario. COMSATS University Islamabad chartered in 2000, started with a single lecture room, meager resources, offering a few certificate courses and a postgraduate diploma in Computer Studies. With the visionary leadership and dedicated team, today it stands at an enviable position, with a choice of seven fully functional campuses along with its virtual campus, 06 Faculties, 18 Departments and around 100 degree programs to its prospective students. In contemporary times, the transformation in the world economy is perennial; technologies evolve at neck breaking speeds. These are extra ordinary times requiring extra ordinary preparations and efforts. Students and parents alike acknowledge the changing trends and are eagerly seeking out institutions of higher learning where their thirst, curiosity and drive for knowledge are adequately convinced; where all round personality development takes place holistically, abreast with knowledge and managerial skills and the drive to lead and succeed; where they can take charge of their future with an open mind while exploring their chosen fields.
